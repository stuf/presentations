## The Overview (1/2)

 1. Brief history of asynchronous Javascript
 2. Problems caused by asynchronicity
 4. The Anatomy of an Observable

v-v-v

## The Hands-on Part (2/2)

 1. Basics of Observables
 2. Modifying observables
 3. Working with Events and Promises
 4. Chaining Observables

note:

- big words in use, but nothing to be scared of
- dependent computations = array.map, where .map is dependent on the array
- combinators = easy way to say a function to combine things with

v-v-v

## Additional things (3/2)

If time allows

 1. Observable combinators<br><small>AKA "you're smarter than you think"</small>
 2. Lazy Computations
 3. Point-free Observables
 4. What is a value, exactly

v-v-v

<small>React stack w/ Observables, no Redux, zero `class` components</small> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:

- specializing in reactive programming through various means
- OP project is pretty cool, but a total mindfuck at first
- POC in march, some legacy cleanup still remaining
- result starting to look pretty sweet
