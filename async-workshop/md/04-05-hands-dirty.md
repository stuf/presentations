## Getting your hands dirty

All these new things

So little time

Let's look at some real-world examples

v-v-v

## Incoming exercises

`exercise-restful.js`

`exercise-restful-click.js`

`exercise-validation.js`

v-v-v

## REST calls

Open `exercise-restful.js`

Fill `undefined` values

v-v-v

## REST calls on demand

Open `exercise-restful-click.js`

Fill `undefined` values

note:

- this time, create an observable for a button's click events
- perform the same REST call as in the previous exercise

v-v-v

## Input validation

Open `exercise-validation.js`

Fill `undefined` values

note:

- we can create simple input validation based on what we've gone through before
- we have an observable for an input field
- use `flatMap[Latest]`
